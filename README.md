#My personal CV project
I tried to develop a code snippet which generates a timeline ouroboros for my CV.

In later stages I could implement some website generating code as well as CV PDF generating code.

Feel free to use the code. The code part is MIT License. 

CV.yaml is not allowed to reuse in any context. Currently it's heavily under development and not accurate at all.
